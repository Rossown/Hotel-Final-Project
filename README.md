# HotelFinalProject

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.7.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

To run on express server run `ng build` to build the dist directory then `cd` into Server and then run `node server.js`. The app then tells you to navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to see the app.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
